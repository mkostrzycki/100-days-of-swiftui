```swift
func printSquare(of number: Int?) {
    guard let number = number else {
        print("Missing input")
        return
    }

    print("\(number) x \(number) is \(number * number)")
}
```

Guard works opposite to `if let`
```swift
var myVar: Int? = 3

if let unwrapped = myVar {
    print("Run if myVar has a value inside")
}

guard let unwrapped = myVar else {
    print("Run if myVar doesn't have a value inside")
}
```
