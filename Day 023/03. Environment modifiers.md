Many modifiers can be applied to containers, which allows us to apply the same modifier to many views at the same time.

```swift
VStack {
    Text("Gryffindor")
    Text("Hufflepuff")
    Text("Ravenclaw")
    Text("Slytherin")
}
.font(.title)
```

This is called an environment modifier, and is different from a regular modifier that is applied to a view.

From a coding perspective these modifiers are used exactly the same way as regular modifiers. However, they behave subtly differently because if any of those child views override the same modifier, the child’s version takes priority.

```swift
VStack {
    Text("Gryffindor")
        .font(.largeTitle)
    Text("Hufflepuff")
    Text("Ravenclaw")
    Text("Slytherin")
}
.font(.title)
```

But there are exceptions. Not every modifier is environment modifier.
```swift
VStack {
    Text("Gryffindor")
        .blur(radius: 0)
    Text("Hufflepuff")
    Text("Ravenclaw")
    Text("Slytherin")
}
.blur(radius: 5)
```
That won’t work the same way: `blur()` is a regular modifier, so any blurs applied to child views are _added_ to the `VStack` blur rather than replacing it.
