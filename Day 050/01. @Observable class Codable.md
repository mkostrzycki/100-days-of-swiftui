```swift
@Observable
class User: Codable {
    var name = "Taylor"
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Button("Encode Taylor", action: encodeTaylor)
    }

    func encodeTaylor() {
        let data = try! JSONEncoder().encode(User())
        let str = String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self)
        print(str)
    }
}
```

What you'll see is unexpected: {"name":"Taylor","$observationRegistrar":{}}. Our name property is now _name, there's also an observation registrar instance in the JSON.

To fix this we need to tell Swift exactly how it should encode and decode our data. This is done by nesting an enum inside our class called `CodingKeys`, and making it have a `String` raw value and a conformance to the `CodingKey` protocol. Yes, that's a bit confusing – the enum is called `CodingKeys`and the protocol is `CodingKey`, but it does matter.

Inside the enum you need to write one case for each property you want to save, along with a raw value containing the name you want to give it. In our case, that means saying that `_name` – the underlying storage for our `name` property – should be written out as the string "name", without an underscore:
```swift
@Observable
class User: Codable {
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case _name = "name"
    }

    var name = "Taylor"
}
```

And that's it! If you try the code again, you'll see the `name` property is named correctly, and there's also no more observation registrar in the mix – the result is much cleaner.

This coding key mapping works both ways: when `Codable` sees `name` in some JSON, it will automatically be saved in the `_name` property.
