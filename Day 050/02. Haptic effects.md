```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var counter = 0

    var body: some View {
        Button("Tap Count: \(counter)") {
            counter += 1
        }
    }
}
```

That's all old code, so let's make it more interesting by adding a haptic effect that triggers whenever the button is pressed â€“ add this modifier to the button:
```swift
.sensoryFeedback(.increase, trigger: counter)
```

For example, we could request a middling collision between two soft objects:
```swift
.sensoryFeedback(.impact(flexibility: .soft, intensity: 0.5), trigger: counter)
```

Or we could specify an intense collision between two heavy objects:
```swift
.sensoryFeedback(.impact(weight: .heavy, intensity: 1), trigger: counter)
```
