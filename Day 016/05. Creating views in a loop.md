We can use `ForEach` for that
```swift
Form {
    ForEach(0 ..< 100) {
        Text("Row \($0)")
    }
}
```

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
	// no need to wrap const in @State
    let students = ["Harry", "Hermione", "Ron"]
    // we need in @State only selected option
    @State private var selectedStudent = "Harry"

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            Form {
                Picker("Select your student", selection: $selectedStudent) {
	                // every element should have unique id
	                // in this case we tell that option values
	                // itselfs are unique
                    ForEach(students, id: \.self) {
                        Text($0)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The only confusing part in there is this: `ForEach(students, id: \.self)`. That loops over the `students` array so we can create a text view for each one, but the `id: \.self` part is important. This exists because SwiftUI needs to be able to identify every view on the screen uniquely, so it can detect when things change.
