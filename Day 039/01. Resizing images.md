```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Image("Example")
    }
}
```

### Asset file name constant
**Tip:** When you're using fixed image names such as this one, Xcode generates constant names for them all that you can use in place of strings. In this case, that means writing `Image(.example)`, which is much safer than using a string!

### Clip image to frame
```swift
Image(.example)
    .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
    .clipped()
```

### Resize image
```swift
Image(.example)
    .resizable()
    .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
```

#### Scale to fit
```swift
Image(.example)
    .resizable()
    .scaledToFit()
    .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
```

#### Scale to fill
```swift
Image(.example)
    .resizable()
    .scaledToFill()
    .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
```

#### Container relative frame
```swift
Image(.example)
    .resizable()
    .scaledToFit()
    .containerRelativeFrame(.horizontal) { size, axis in
        size * 0.8
    }
```

Let's break that code down:
1. We're saying we want to give this image a frame relative to the horizontal size of its parent. We aren't specifying a vertical size; more on that in a moment.
2. SwiftUI then runs a closure where we're given a size and an axis. For us the axis will be `.horizontal` because that's the one we're using, but this matters more when you create relative horizontal _and_ vertical sizes. The `size` value will be the size of our container, which for this image is the full screen.
3. We need to return the size we want for this axis, so we're sending back 80% of the container's width.
