Go back to the Guess the Flag project and add some animation: 
1. When you tap a flag, make it spin around 360 degrees on the Y axis.
2. Make the other two buttons fade out to 25% opacity.
3. Add a third effect of your choosing to the two flags the user didn’t choose – maybe make them scale down? Or flip in a different direction? Experiment!

**These challenges aren’t easy.** They take only a few lines of code, but you’ll need to think carefully about what modifiers you use to get the exact animations you want. Try adding an `@State` property to track which flag the user tapped on, then using that inside conditional modifiers for rotation, fading, and whatever you decide for the third challenge.
