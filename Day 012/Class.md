```swift
class Game {
    var score = 0 {
        didSet {
            print("Score is now \(score)")
        }
    }
}

var newGame = Game()
newGame.score += 10
```

First, the things that classes and structs have in common include:
- You get to create and name them.
- You can add properties and methods, including property observers and access control.
- You can create custom initializers to configure new instances however you want.

However, classes differ from structs in five key places:
1. You can make one class build upon functionality in another class, gaining all its properties and methods as a starting point. If you want to selectively override some methods, you can do that too.
2. Because of that first point, Swift won’t automatically generate a memberwise initializer for classes. This means you either need to write your own initializer, or assign default values to all your properties.
3. When you copy an instance of a class, both copies share the same data – if you change one copy, the other one also changes.
4. When the final copy of a class instance is destroyed, Swift can optionally run a special function called a _deinitializer_.
5. Even if you make a class constant, you can still change its properties as long as they are variables.
