Swift gives us a function called `fatalError()` that lets us respond to unresolvable problems really clearly. When we call `fatalError()` it will – unconditionally and always – cause our app to crash. It will just die. Not “might die” or “maybe die”: it will always just terminate straight away.

```swift
func startGame() {
    // 1. Find the URL for start.txt in our app bundle
    if let startWordsURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "start", withExtension: "txt") {
        // 2. Load start.txt into a string
        if let startWords = try? String(contentsOf: startWordsURL) {
            // 3. Split the string up into an array of strings, splitting on line breaks
            let allWords = startWords.components(separatedBy: "\n")

            // 4. Pick one random word, or use "silkworm" as a sensible default
            rootWord = allWords.randomElement() ?? "silkworm"

            // If we are here everything has worked, so we can exit
            return
        }
    }

    // If were are *here* then there was a problem – trigger a crash and report the error
    fatalError("Could not load start.txt from bundle.")
}
```
