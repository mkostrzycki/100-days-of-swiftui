```swift
@Query(filter: #Predicate<User> { user in
    user.name.contains("R")
}, sort: \User.name) var users: [User]
```

Let's break that down:
1. The filter starts with `#Predicate<User>`, which means we're writing a predicate (a fancy word for a test we're going to apply).
2. That predicate gives us a single user instance to check. In practice that will be called once for each user loaded by SwiftData, and we need to return true if that user should be included in the results.
3. Our test checks whether the user's name contains the capital letter R. If it does, the user will be included in the results, otherwise they won't.

That works great for a simple test of predicates, but it's very rare users actually care about capital letters – they usually just want to write a few letters, and look for that match anywhere in the results, ignoring case. 

For this purpose, iOS gives us a separate method `localizedStandardContains()`. This also takes a string to search for, except it automatically ignores letter case, so it's a much better option when you're trying to filter by user text.

Here's how it looks:
```swift
@Query(filter: #Predicate<User> { user in
    user.name.localizedStandardContains("R")
}, sort: \User.name) var users: [User]
```

Now let's go a step further: let's upgrade our filter so that it matches people who have an "R" in their name and who live in London:
```swift
@Query(filter: #Predicate<User> { user in
    user.name.localizedStandardContains("R") &&
    user.city == "London"
}, sort: \User.name) var users: [User]
```

You can add more and more checks like this, but using `&&` gets a bit confusing. Fortunately, these predicates support a _limited subset_ of Swift expressions that make reading a little easier.

For example, we could rewrite our current predicate to this:
```swift
@Query(filter: #Predicate<User> { user in
    if user.name.localizedStandardContains("R") {
        if user.city == "London" {
            return true
        } else {
            return false
        }
    } else {
        return false
    }
}, sort: \User.name) var users: [User]
```

Important: We must provide single expression in Predict, so we can't write like this:
```swift
@Query(filter: #Predicate<User> { user in
    if user.name.localizedStandardContains("R") {
        if user.city == "London" {
            return true
        }
    }

    return false // ERROR - it's not single expression
}, sort: \User.name) var users: [User]
```
