### Convert string to array (like explode in PHP)
Swift gives us a method called `components(separatedBy:)` that can converts a single string into an array of strings by breaking it up wherever another string is found. For example, this will create the array `["a", "b", "c"]`:
```swift
let input = "a b c"
let letters = input.components(separatedBy: " ")
```

```swift
let input = """
            a
            b
            c
            """
let letters = input.components(separatedBy: "\n")
```

### Trim whitespaces
```swift
let letter = letters.randomElement() // optional
let trimmed = letter?.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
```

### Text Checker
Checking a string for misspelled words takes four steps in total. First, we create a word to check and an instance of `UITextChecker` that we can use to check that string:
```swift
let word = "swift"
let checker = UITextChecker()
```

Second, we need to tell the checker how much of our string we want to check. If you imagine a spellchecker in a word processing app, you might want to check only the text the user selected rather than the entire document.
```swift
let range = NSRange(location: 0, length: word.utf16.count)
```

Third, we can ask our text checker to report where it found any misspellings in our word, passing in the range to check, a position to start within the range (so we can do things like “Find Next”), whether it should wrap around once it reaches the end, and what language to use for the dictionary:
```swift
let misspelledRange = checker.rangeOfMisspelledWord(in: word, range: range, startingAt: 0, wrap: false, language: "en")
```

In this instance, if the Objective-C range comes back as empty – i.e., if there was no spelling mistake because the string was spelled correctly – then we get back the special value `NSNotFound`.

So, we could check our spelling result to see whether there was a mistake or not like this:
```swift
let allGood = misspelledRange.location == NSNotFound
```
