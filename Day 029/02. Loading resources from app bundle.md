If we want to read the URL for a file in our main app bundle, we use `Bundle.main.url()`. If the file exists it will be sent back to us, otherwise we’ll get back `nil`, so this is an optional `URL`. That means we need to unwrap it like this:
```swift
if let fileURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "some-file", withExtension: "txt") {
    // we found the file in our bundle!
}
```

Once we have a URL, we can load it into a string with a special initializer: `String(contentsOf:)`. We give this a file URL, and it will send back a string containing the contents of that file if it can be loaded. If it _can’t_ be loaded it throws an error, so you you need to call this using `try` or `try?` like this:
```swift
if let fileContents = try? String(contentsOf: fileURL) {
    // we loaded the file into a string!
}
```
