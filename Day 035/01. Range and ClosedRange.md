```swift
ForEach(0..<5) {
    Text("Row \($0)")
}
```

In fact, if you look at the SwiftUI code behind our `ForEach` you’ll see it’s actually this:
```swift
public init(_ data: Range<Int>, @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (Int) -> Content)
```

Now try writing this:
```swift
ForEach(0...5) {
   Text("Row \($0)")
}
```

That counts from 0 _through_ 5, meaning that it will create six views. Or at least it _would_ create six views if it actually worked – that code doesn’t compile.

Look again at the type of data `ForEach` wants: `Range<Int>`. That’s a range of integers, but it’s a very specific range – there’s a second, very similar type called `ClosedRange<Int>`, and that’s what’s causing the problem.

When we write `0..<5` we get a `Range<Int>`, but when we write `0...5` we get a `ClosedRange<Int>`. Even though it looks similar to us, Swift considers these two range types to be different and so we can’t use a closed range with `ForEach` – it just isn’t possible right now, although I hope that will change.
