```swift
@Model
class User {
    var name: String
    var city: String
    var joinDate: Date
    var jobs = [Job]()

    init(name: String, city: String, joinDate: Date) {
        self.name = name
        self.city = city
        self.joinDate = joinDate
    }
}

@Model
class Job {
    var name: String
    var priority: Int
    var owner: User?

    init(name: String, priority: Int, owner: User? = nil) {
        self.name = name
        self.priority = priority
        self.owner = owner
    }
}
```

**Tip:** When we used the `modelContainer()` modifier in our `App` struct, we passed in `User.self` so that SwiftData knew to set up storage for that model. We don't need to add `Job.self` there because SwiftData can see there's a relationship between the two, so it takes care of both automatically.

```swift
func addSample() {
    let user1 = User(name: "Piper Chapman", city: "New York", joinDate: .now)
    let job1 = Job(name: "Organize sock drawer", priority: 3)
    let job2 = Job(name: "Make plans with Alex", priority: 4)

    modelContext.insert(user1)

    user1.jobs.append(job1)
    user1.jobs.append(job2)
}
```

On default, Swift will not delete Jobs when we delete User. We can change this behavior
Change the `jobs` property in `User` to this:
```swift
@Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade) var jobs = [Job]()
```
