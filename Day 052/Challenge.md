1. Our address fields are currently considered valid if they contain anything, even if it’s just only whitespace. Improve the validation to make sure a string of pure whitespace is invalid.
2. If our call to `placeOrder()` fails – for example if there is no internet connection – show an informative alert for the user. To test this, try commenting out the `request.httpMethod = "POST"` line in your code, which should force the request to fail.
3. For a more challenging task, try updating the `Order` class so it saves data such as the user's delivery address to `UserDefaults`. This takes a little thinking, because `@AppStorage` won't work here, and you'll find getters and setters cause problems with `Codable` support. Can you find a middle ground?
