```swift
struct User {
    var firstName = "Bilbo"
    var lastName = "Baggins"
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var user = User()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Your name is \(user.firstName) \(user.lastName).")

            TextField("First name", text: $user.firstName)
            TextField("Last name", text: $user.lastName)
        }
    }
}
```

That all works: SwiftUI is smart enough to understand that one object contains all our data, and will update the UI when either value changes. Behind the scenes, what’s actually happening is that each time a value inside our struct changes the _whole_ struct changes – it’s like a new user every time we type a key for the first or last name. That might sound wasteful, but it’s actually extremely fast.

```swift
class User {
    var firstName = "Bilbo"
    var lastName = "Baggins"
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var user = User()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Your name is \(user.firstName) \(user.lastName).")

            TextField("First name", text: $user.firstName)
            TextField("Last name", text: $user.lastName)
        }
    }
}
```

Now that `User` is a class the property itself isn’t changing, so `@State` doesn’t notice anything and can’t reload the view. Yes, the values _inside_ the class are changing, but `@State` doesn’t monitor those, so effectively what’s happening is that the values inside our class are being changed but the view isn’t being reloaded to reflect that change.

We can fix this problem with one small change: I'd like you to add the line `@Observable` before the class. It should look like this:
```swift
@Observable
class User {
```
