```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let firstName: String
    let lastName: String
}

...

@State private var user = User(firstName: "Taylor", lastName: "Swift")

...

Button("Save User") {
    let encoder = JSONEncoder()

    if let data = try? encoder.encode(user) {
        UserDefaults.standard.set(data, forKey: "UserData")
    }
}
```

When working with data like this, Swift gives us a fantastic protocol called `Codable`: a protocol specifically for _archiving_ and _unarchiving_ data, which is a fancy way of saying “converting objects into plain text and back again.”

The `Codable` protocol doesn’t require that we use JSON, and in fact other formats are available, but it is by far the most common. In this instance, we don’t actually care _what_ sort of data is used, because it’s just going to be stored in `UserDefaults`.

We are using `UserDefaults` directly rather than going through `@AppStorage`, because the `@AppStorage` property wrapper just doesn’t work here.
