The simplest image we can create looks like this:
```swift
AsyncImage(url: URL(string: "https://hws.dev/img/logo.png"))
```

We can tell SwiftUI ahead of time that we’re trying to load a 3x scale image, like this:
```swift
AsyncImage(url: URL(string: "https://hws.dev/img/logo.png"), scale: 3)
```

We could make the finished image view be both resizable and scaled to fit, and use `Color.red` as the placeholder so it’s more obvious while you’re learning.
```swift
AsyncImage(url: URL(string: "https://hws.dev/img/logo.png")) { image in
    image
        .resizable()
        .scaledToFit()
} placeholder: {
    Color.red
}
.frame(width: 200, height: 200)
```

If you want _complete_ control over your remote image, there’s a third way of creating `AsyncImage` that tells us whether the image was loaded, hit an error, or hasn’t finished yet. This is particularly useful for times when you want to show a dedicated view when the download fails – if the URL doesn’t exist, or the user was offline, etc.

Here’s how that looks:
```swift
AsyncImage(url: URL(string: "https://hws.dev/img/bad.png")) { phase in
    if let image = phase.image {
        image
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
    } else if phase.error != nil {
        Text("There was an error loading the image.")
    } else {
        ProgressView()
    }
}
.frame(width: 200, height: 200)
```
