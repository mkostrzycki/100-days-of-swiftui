1. Change project 7 (iExpense) so that it uses `NavigationLink` for adding new expenses rather than a sheet. (Tip: The `dismiss()` code works great here, but you might want to add the `navigationBarBackButtonHidden()` modifier so they have to explicitly choose Cancel.)
2. Try changing project 7 so that it lets users edit their issue name in the navigation title rather than a separate textfield. Which option do you prefer?
3. Return to project 8 (Moonshot), and upgrade it to use `NavigationLink(value:)`. This means adding `Hashable` conformance, and thinking carefully how to use `navigationDestination()`.
