```swift
// create an integer to store our roll
var roll = 0

// carry on looping until we reach 20
while roll != 20 {
    // roll a new dice and print what it was
    roll = Int.random(in: 1...20)
    print("I rolled a \(roll)")
}

// if we're here it means the loop ended â€“ we got a 20!    
print("Critical hit!")
```
