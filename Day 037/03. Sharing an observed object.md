We can add a property to `AddView` to store an `Expenses` object.
```swift
var expenses: Expenses
```

And now we can pass our existing `Expenses` object from one view to another – they will both share the same object, and will both monitor it for changes. Modify your `sheet()` modifier in `ContentView` to this:
```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $showingAddExpense) {
    AddView(expenses: expenses)
}
```

To fix the preview, we can pass dummy value
```swift
#Preview
    AddView(expenses: Expenses())
}
```
