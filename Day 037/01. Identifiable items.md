We could use UUID
```swift
struct ExpenseItem {
    let id = UUID()
    let name: String
    let type: String
    let amount: Double
}
```

And change id field in ForEach
```swift
ForEach(expenses.items, id: \.id) { item in
    Text(item.name)
}
```

Or even better we can change struct that it will conform Identifiable protocol (we must provide property called id with identifier)
```swift
struct ExpenseItem: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let name: String
    let type: String
    let amount: Double
}
```

And now we can skip pointing id property name in ForEach
```swift
ForEach(expenses.items) { item in
    Text(item.name)
}
```
