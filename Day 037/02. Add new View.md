To make a new SwiftUI view you can either press Cmd+N or go to the File menu and choose New > File. Either way, you should select “SwiftUI View” under the User Interface category, then name the file AddView.swift. Xcode will ask you where to save the file, so make sure you see a folder icon next to “iExpense”, then click Create to have Xcode show you the new view, ready to edit.
