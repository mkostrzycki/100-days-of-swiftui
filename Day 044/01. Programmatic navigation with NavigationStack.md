In SwiftUI this is done by binding the path of a `NavigationStack` to an array of whatever data you're navigating with. So, we might start with this:
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var path = [Int]()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack(path: $path) {
            VStack {
                Button("Show 32") {
				    path = [32]
				}
				
				Button("Show 64") {
				    path.append(64)
				}

				Button("Show 32 then 64") {
				    path = [32, 64]
				}
            }
            .navigationDestination(for: Int.self) { selection in
                Text("You selected \(selection)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

That does two important things:

1. It creates an `@State` property to store an array of integers.
2. It binds that property to the `path` of our `NavigationStack`, meaning that changing the array will automatically navigate to whatever is in the array, but also changes the array as the user presses Back in the navigation bar.
