You’ve seen how SwiftUI lets us create implicit animations by attaching the `animation()` modifier to a view, and how it also lets us create animated binding changes by adding the `animation()` modifier to a binding, but there’s a third useful way we can create animations: explicitly asking SwiftUI to animate changes occurring as the result of a state change.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var animationAmount = 0.0

    var body: some View {
        Button("Tap Me") {
            withAnimation(.spring(duration: 1, bounce: 0.5)) {
			    animationAmount += 360
			}
        }
        .padding(50)
        .background(.red)
        .foregroundStyle(.white)
        .clipShape(.circle)
        .rotation3DEffect(.degrees(animationAmount), axis: (x: 0, y: 1, z: 0))
    }
}
```
