```swift
NavigationStack {
    Text("Hello, world!")
    .toolbar {
        ToolbarItem(placement: .topBarLeading) {
            Button("Tap Me") {
                // button action here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Although that works well, usually it's better to use one of the semantic options – placement that have specific meaning, rather than relying just on their location. These include:
- `.confirmationAction`, when you want users to agree to something, such as agreeing to terms of service.
- `.destructiveAction`, when the user needs to make a choice to destroy whatever it is they are working with, such as confirming they want to remove some data they created.
- `.cancellationAction`, when the user needs to back out of changes they have made, such as discarding changes they have made.
- `.navigation`, which is used for buttons that make the user move between data, such as going back and forward in a web browser.

**Tip:** If you need the user to decide between saving a change or discarding it, you might want to add the `navigationBarBackButtonHidden()` modifier so that they can't tap Back to exit without making a choice.

If you want multiple buttons using the same placement, you can either repeat `ToolbarItem` like this:
```swift
.toolbar {
    ToolbarItem(placement: .topBarLeading) {
        Button("Tap Me") {
            // button action here
        }
    }

    ToolbarItem(placement: .topBarLeading) {
        Button("Or Tap Me") {
            // button action here
        }
    }
}
```

Or you can use `ToolbarItemGroup`, like this:
```swift
.toolbar {
    ToolbarItemGroup(placement: .topBarLeading) {
        Button("Tap Me") {
            // button action here
        }

        Button("Tap Me 2") {
            // button action here
        }
    }
}
```

Both should produce the same result.
