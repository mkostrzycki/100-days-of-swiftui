In the simplest form of SwiftUI navigation, we provide both a label and a destination view in one single `NavigationLink`, like this:
```swift
NavigationStack {
    NavigationLink("Tap Me") {
        Text("Detail View")
    }
}
```

But for more advanced navigation, it's better to separate the destination from the value. This allows SwiftUI to load the destination only when it's needed.

Doing this takes two steps:

1. We attach a value to the `NavigationLink`. This value can be anything you want – a string, an integer, a custom struct instance, or whatever. However, there is one requirement: whatever type you use must conform to a protocol called `Hashable`.
2. Attaching a `navigationDestination()` modifier inside the navigation stack, telling it what to do when it receives your data.

```swift
NavigationStack {
    List(0..<100) { i in
        NavigationLink("Select \(i)", value: i)
    }
    .navigationDestination(for: Int.self) { selection in
        Text("You selected \(selection)")
    }
}
```

**Tip:** If you have several different types of data to navigate to them, just add several `navigationDestination()` modifiers. In effect you're saying, "do this when you want to navigate to an integer, but do _that_ when you want to navigate to a string."

# Hashable
That works great for lots of data, such as navigating to strings, integers, and UUIDs. But for more complex data such as custom structs, we need to use _hashing_.

```swift
struct Student: Hashable {
    var id = UUID()
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}
```

Now that our `Student` struct conforms to `Hashable` it can be used with both `NavigationLink` and `navigationDestination()` just like integers or strings
