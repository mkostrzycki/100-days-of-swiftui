```swift
Stepper("^[\(coffeeAmount) cup](inflect: true)", value: $coffeeAmount, in: 1...20)
```

This is odd syntax, I know, but it's actually a specialized form of Markdown, which is a common text-format. This syntax tells SwiftUI that the word "cup" needs to be inflected to match whatever is in the `coffeeAmount` variable, which in this case means it will automatically be converted from "cup" to "cups" as appropriate.
