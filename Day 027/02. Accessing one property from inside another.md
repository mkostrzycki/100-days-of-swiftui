Accessing one property from inside another – Swift doesn’t know which order the properties will be created in, so this isn’t allowed.

The fix here is simple: we can make `defaultWakeTime` a static variable, which means it belongs to the `ContentView` struct itself rather than a single instance of that struct. This in turn means `defaultWakeTime` can be read whenever we want, because it doesn’t rely on the existence of any other properties.

```swift
@State private var wakeUp = defaultWakeTime
...
static var defaultWakeTime: Date {
    var components = DateComponents()
    components.hour = 7
    components.minute = 0
    return Calendar.current.date(from: components) ?? .now
}
```
