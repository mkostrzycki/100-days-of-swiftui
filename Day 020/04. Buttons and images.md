```swift
Button("Delete selection") {
    print("Now deleting…")
}
```

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Button("Delete selection", action: executeDelete)
    }

    func executeDelete() {
        print("Now deleting…")
    }
}
```

Button role
```swift
Button("Delete selection", role: .destructive, action: executeDelete)
```

Button styles
```swift
VStack {
    Button("Button 1") { }
        .buttonStyle(.bordered)
    Button("Button 2", role: .destructive) { }
        .buttonStyle(.bordered)
    Button("Button 3") { }
        .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
    Button("Button 4", role: .destructive) { }
        .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
}
```

customize color
```swift
Button("Button 3") { }
    .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
    .tint(.mint)
```

**Important:** Apple explicitly recommends against using too many prominent buttons, because when everything is prominent nothing is.

Custom button
```swift
Button {
    print("Button was tapped")
} label: {
    Text("Tap me!")
        .padding()
        .foregroundStyle(.white)
        .background(.red)
}
```

### Images
SwiftUI has a dedicated `Image` type for handling pictures in your apps, and there are three main ways you will create them:
- `Image("pencil")` will load an image called “Pencil” that you have added to your project.
- `Image(decorative: "pencil")` will load the same image, but won’t read it out for users who have enabled the screen reader. This is useful for images that don’t convey additional important information.
- `Image(systemName: "pencil")` will load the pencil icon that is built into iOS. This uses Apple’s SF Symbols icon collection, and you can search for icons you like – download Apple’s free SF Symbols app from the web to see the full set.

```swift
Button {
    print("Edit button was tapped")
} label: { 
    Image(systemName: "pencil")
}
```

```swift
Button("Edit", systemImage: "pencil") {
    print("Edit button was tapped")
}
```

```swift
Button {
    print("Edit button was tapped")
} label: {
    Label("Edit", systemImage: "pencil")
        .padding()
        .foregroundStyle(.white)
        .background(.red)
}
```
