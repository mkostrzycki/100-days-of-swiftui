We can pass our `Double` to `TextField` and ask it to treat the input as a currency, like this:
```swift
TextField("Amount", value: $checkAmount, format: .currency(code: "USD"))
```

We can do even better - use user current locale currency
```swift
TextField("Amount", value: $checkAmount, format: .currency(code: Locale.current.currency?.identifier ?? "USD"))
```

We can change keyboard type that will show when user will edit TextField. In this case we will use `.keyboardType(.decimalPad)`
```swift
TextField("Amount", value: $checkAmount, format: .currency(code: Locale.current.currency?.identifier ?? "USD"))
                    .keyboardType(.decimalPad)
```

**Tip:** The `.numberPad` and `.decimalPad` keyboard types tell SwiftUI to show the digits 0 through 9 and optionally also the decimal point, but that doesn’t stop users from _entering_ other values. For example, if they have a hardware keyboard they can type what they like, and if they copy some text from elsewhere they’ll be able to paste that into the text field no matter what is inside that text. That’s OK, though – the text field will automatically filter out bad values when they hit Return.
