There is no button to hide numeric keyboard. We will use element focus to solve that.

Add new variable wrapped in `@FocusState`
```swift
@FocusState private var amountIsFocused: Bool
```

Add `.focused` to field with amount (form input field)
```swift
.focused($amountIsFocused)
```

Add modifier to form - add button to toolbar when input is focused
```swift
.toolbar {
    if amountIsFocused {
        Button("Done") {
            amountIsFocused = false
        }
    }
}
```

Taping Done button will remove focus from input field, hide keyboard and hide Done button in toolbar.
