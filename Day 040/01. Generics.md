To make a method generic, we give it a placeholder for certain types. This is written in angle brackets (`<`and `>`) after the method name but before its parameters, like this:

```swift
func decode<T>(_ file: String) -> T {
```

If we use for example `decode`
```swift
return try decoder.decode(T.self, from: data)
```

We will get error
`“Instance method 'decode(_:from:)' requires that 'T' conform to 'Decodable’”.`

We must change method signature
```swift
func decode<T: Codable>(_ file: String) -> T {
```

When we call method, we must say what type we expected:
```swift
let astronauts: [String: Astronaut] = Bundle.main.decode("astronauts.json")

let missions: [Mission] = Bundle.main.decode("missions.json")
```
