Using the simple version, we might ask for our books to be provided in alphabetical order based on their title:
```swift
@Query(sort: \Book.title) var books: [Book]
```

Or we could ask for them to be sorted by rating, highest to lowest:
```swift
@Query(sort: \Book.rating, order: .reverse) var books: [Book]
```

It's a better idea to have a backup field too – to say "sort by rating, then by title" adds an extra level of predictability to your app, which is always a good thing.

This is done using the `SortDescriptor` type, which we can create them from either one or two values: the property we want to sort on, and optionally whether it should be reversed or not. 
```swift
@Query(sort: [SortDescriptor(\Book.title, order: .reverse)]) var books: [Book]
```

You can specify more than one sort descriptor, and they will be applied in the order you provide them. 
```swift
@Query(sort: [
    SortDescriptor(\Book.title),
    SortDescriptor(\Book.author)
]) var books: [Book]
```
