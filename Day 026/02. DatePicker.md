```swift
@State private var wakeUp = Date.now

...
DatePicker("Please enter a date", selection: $wakeUp)
```

We can hide label
```swift
DatePicker("Please enter a date", selection: $wakeUp)
    .labelsHidden()
```

Date pickers provide us with a couple of configuration options that control how they work. First, we can use `displayedComponents` to decide what kind of options users should see:
- If you don’t provide this parameter, users see a day, hour, and minute.
- If you use `.date` users see month, day, and year.
- If you use `.hourAndMinute` users see just the hour and minute components.

```swift
DatePicker("Please enter a time", selection: $wakeUp, displayedComponents: .hourAndMinute)
```

Date range
```swift
func exampleDates() {
    // create a second Date instance set to one day in seconds from now
    let tomorrow = Date.now.addingTimeInterval(86400)

    // create a range from those two
    let range = Date.now...tomorrow
}
```

```swift
DatePicker("Please enter a date", selection: $wakeUp, in: Date.now...)
```
