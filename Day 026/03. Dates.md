```swift
let now = Date.now
let tomorrow = Date.now.addingTimeInterval(86400)
let range = now...tomorrow
```

As you’ve seen, Swift gives us `Date` for working with dates, and that encapsulates the year, month, date, hour, minute, second, timezone, and more. However, we don’t want to think about most of that – we want to say “give me an 8am wake up time, regardless of what day it is today.”

Swift has a slightly different type for that purpose, called `DateComponents`, which lets us read or write specific parts of a date rather than the whole thing.

So, if we wanted a date that represented 8am today, we could write code like this:
```swift
var components = DateComponents()
components.hour = 8
components.minute = 0
let date = Calendar.current.date(from: components) ?? .now
```

```swift
let components = Calendar.current.dateComponents([.hour, .minute], from: someDate)
let hour = components.hour ?? 0
let minute = components.minute ?? 0
```

Date formatting
```swift
Text(Date.now, format: .dateTime.hour().minute())
```

```swift
Text(Date.now, format: .dateTime.day().month().year())
```

```swift
Text(Date.now.formatted(date: .long, time: .shortened))
```
