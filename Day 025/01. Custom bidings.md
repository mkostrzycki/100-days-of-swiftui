Simple custom binding:
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var selection = 0

    var body: some View {
        let binding = Binding(
            get: { selection },
            set: { selection = $0 }
        )

        VStack {
            Picker("Select a number", selection: binding) {
                ForEach(0..<3) {
                    Text("Item \($0)")
                }
            }
            .pickerStyle(.segmented)
        }
    }
}
```

Example - four toggle switches, one for check all
We can create four toggle switches: one each for the individual Booleans, and one control switch that agrees or disagrees to all three at once:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var agreedToTerms = false
    @State private var agreedToPrivacyPolicy = false
    @State private var agreedToEmails = false

    var body: some View {
        let agreedToAll = Binding<Bool>(
            get: {
                agreedToTerms && agreedToPrivacyPolicy && agreedToEmails
            },
            set: {
                agreedToTerms = $0
                agreedToPrivacyPolicy = $0
                agreedToEmails = $0
            }
        )

        VStack {
            Toggle("Agree to terms", isOn: $agreedToTerms)
            Toggle("Agree to privacy policy", isOn: $agreedToPrivacyPolicy)
            Toggle("Agree to receive shipping emails", isOn: $agreedToEmails)
            Toggle("Agree to all", isOn: agreedToAll)
        }
    }
}
```
